        units.push("The first thing to note is that Keynes's analogy in application to the stock market is itself limited. It mis-places the role of the central authority. It inserts a discrete 'prize,' funded by a central authority, as the motive for playing, and the awarding of the prize ends the game. In the stock market, people may invest in response to popular opinion and may be 'ahead' or 'behind' on their balance sheets according to stock choice and timing. But over time the material basis of share prices will be revealed by what state-certified corporate accounts actually show to be the profit performances of companies. The state's role is not as a prize-giver to attract short-term audience participation but as a rule-maker to ensure reliable data.");

In Keynes' beauty contest, the contestants are not the faces (as would be implied by the term 'beauty contest') but the newspaper readers/voters. With reciprocal staking, the analogy would be if the only people who can vote in the beauty contest are the 100 contestants; they can divide their votes into fractions, and there is no winner-takes-all 'prize': the prize is connectivity. So there is no 'winning' from voting for yourself and, directly or transitively, it is likely that everyone will be holding a partial vote for everyone else, so prizes are as much collective as individual.");
        units.push("If we think of the 100 people whose faces appear in the contest, each having their own ways of identifying facial attributes (their own measures of value), there will be built across the network not a speculative bubble but a system of facial recognition. Distributed determination of value is a system of network recognition of value.");
        units.push("Two years before Keynes' _General Theory_ was published, the idea of fundamental value rose to new prominence with developments in the analytics of corporate accounts. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd published _Security Analysis_ (1934), introducing the concept of 'value investing.' Their work has been made famous in the 21st century by Warren Buffett.[98]");
        units.push("The approach they took was to look at the intrinsic worth, or long-term 'fundamentals,' of a company and not be distracted by short-term share price volatility. The fundamentals include measures like company performance, profit margins, asset values, debt levels, etc.. The investment proposition was to use data on these fundamentals to reach an overall valuation of the company. This was then a guide to whether current stock prices were 'overpriced' or 'underpriced,' with direct implications as to whether the stock should be bought or sold at its current price.");
        units.push("Each of these fundamentals depicted by Graham and Dodd in 1934 is generally defined by reference to a distinctly capitalist economy and, we contend, an early to mid 20th century capitalist economy. In the 21st century, most of the largest and fastest growing companies in the world, when measured by market capitalization - such as Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Tesla - have share prices far in excess of what Graham and Dodd's measures would recommend, and have done so for some time.[99] To label these prices as 'speculative' and 'bubbles,' especially when they have lasted so long, seems to be a misreading of underlying processes.");
        units.push("We believe that these stocks are symptoms of a change in what we should understand by 'intrinsic worth' and 'fundamentals.' Two factors are critical here. One is that the intangible assets that dominate these companies' balance sheets - software patents and brands - cannot easily be subject to Graham and Dodd's measures.[100] The second factor is that investors in these iconic 21st century companies are not simply speculators, nor are they simply 'factoring in' environmental, social and governance (ESG) qualifiers to their profit-driven calculus.[101] Many are taking an intentional long-term position on the future of the economy and wider society. In a changing world, they are investing in intentional modes of change. They are signaling financially what they believe in and what they project the future economic frontiers to be. Neither Keynes' depiction of speculation nor Graham and Dodd's depiction of intrinsic value appear able to capture this motivation.");

        units.push("In the financial language that frames our approach, a surplus is a spread. In neoclassical economics, focussed as it is on exchange relations, the surplus is in individual relations between buyers and sellers: it is the spread between the price a buyer/seller would have been willing to accept and the price at which they do accept an offer. In Marx, surplus value is a class-based spread between the value of labor power (approximately equal to the wage) and the new value created by current labor. Piero Sraffa's (1960) adaptation of Marx, which has been an important underlying influence in our analysis, poses the surplus as the spread between the commodities used up in the process of production and the commodities created by the process of production. When we extend Sraffa from a commodity world to a financial world, the surplus is simply output values created that are not paid for. Non-payment is not about theft, but the capacity of human endeavor to create, such that inputs into production are not sufficient to account for the value of outputs.");
        units.push("The Sraffian depiction seems valuable because of its generality: the neo-classical depiction is simply about 'bargains' in trading - a depiction without useful social meaning - and Marx's is specific to capitalist relations between labor and capital. The Sraffian surplus includes Marx's surplus, albeit that the emphasis is not on extractive relations (i.e. that one class produces the surplus and another owns it) but its analytical benefit is that it can describe also a surplus in market-based, commodity producing societies that are precapitalist (late feudal) and a postcapitalist (a 'market socialist'[102]) economy. Sraffa's ledgers resonate with those we describe in later chapters, and give us some tools to describe a postcapitalist surplus.");
        units.push("But Sraffa's depiction also has an immediate limitation for our purpose, for it is explicitly a depiction of a surplus created in a non-monetary, commodity-producing economy (recall Sraffa's major work is called _Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities_). If surplus is attributed to the human endeavor to create, then we should not presume that the creative outputs of that endeavor are only and always commodities produced for a market. We prefer the extended Sraffian conception of the surplus as 'outputs not paid for,' which gives us an open-ended framing of what constitutes an 'output.'");
        units.push("When our analysis opens up the conception of value in a postcapitalist economy we can also define the surplus as a spread. In the performance evaluation framework (see Appendix 4.1) the surplus is the spread between the value of network performance inputs and outputs, where outputs are valued by the network evaluation of the social outcomes they generate. In the derivative framing (Appendix 5.2) this spread is the value of the swap.");
        units.push("At this stage of the analysis we are now in a position to clarify (somewhat) the surplus of the new economic space. The surplus will take the form of dividends on stake, so it is appropriate to repeat the depiction of a dividend from Chapter 5.3:\\nIt may be a share of output, or a share of the net revenue (outputs less the cost of inputs). It could be a financial return or a commodity output return, and those returns may accrue directly to the stakeholder or to some other agent nominated by the stakeholder, such as the commons (see Chapter 6). It could also give other rights; for example, rights to influence the future evolution of the performance, or it could give the stakeholder rights to build their own performance in connection with the performance they staked.");
        units.push("That list is open-ended: it can be whatever an agent's performance specifies the intended dividend to be. Some part of these dividends are not surplus: they are the conditions of reproduction of the performances of stakeholders either directly (by being used as inputs in their performances) or indirectly, by being sold to enable the purchase of other inputs. Indeed, in the case of the commons, where outputs may be allocated for free, the existence of dividends may be significant for the stake price of the producer, and _that_ is essential to the reproduction of the producer's performance. We cannot, _ex ante_, specify what fraction is surplus and what is necessary for reproduction.");
        units.push("However, this is not the full surplus. The definition above is the aggregate of private surpluses. We must also recognize the possibility that the network overall is more than the sum of its parts: that the whole network is a performance, and hence a potential source of surplus. The formalization of this collective dimension must await the analysis of the total network. But it is important to emphasize the muti-dimensionality of that surplus, associated with the multi-dimensionality of network value.");
        units.push("Our framing of the network surplus, especially as the spread between the costs of performances and the outcomes of performances (including the new economic space performance) comes close to what Brian Massumi has called in his '_99 Theses_' 'processual surplus value' or the 'surplus-value of life.' Massumi's Thesis 16 states:\\nMarx's definition of surplus-value hinges on the labor theory of value, according to which value is the quantity of labor-time that is 'congealed' in the product. Processual surplus value . . . is purely qualitative and concerns the intensity of lived potentials. It is surplus-value of life. Capitalist surplus-value and processual surplus-value are, of course, related, but they cannot be equated. The former is the systemic capture of the latter. Their difference-the difference between quality of activity as such and the derivation from it of a quantitative yield-is internalized by the system, to serve as its driving force. (2018: 16)");
        units.push("And elsewhere, by way of summary, the 'surplus value of life' is:\\nan experienced value that is its own value, worth it for itself. This is a purely qualitative value. It is as incomparable as the timbre of a particularly pellucid note of music or the saturation of a breath-taking color. It is incommensurable, unexchangeable. It is such as it was, all and only that, and nothing more than how it was lived. It can be pursued on the smallest or most macro of scales, beginning from right where one is. No need to wait for the correct, final analysis (which will never come) before jumping in. No need for the end-all up front (which will never happen). Any and every moment can yield surplus-value of life, provided the moment is intensely lived. (2018: 91)");
        units.push("The concept of surplus we are working with has some close parallel with what Massumi's idea of processual surplus value is reaching for, because value is determined by the processes of the network. But for Massumi, it is critical that the surplus-value of life is unquantifiable. Thesis 5 states that:\\nThe first task of the revaluation of value is to uncouple value from quantification. Value must be recognized for what it is: irreducibly qualitative. (2018: 4)\\nQuantification, he believes, draws surplus back to the capitalist world of commodity production, at least until the concept of value can be reclaimed and freed from capitalist calculation.");
        units.push("Our analysis agrees with one aspect of this statement, which is why we contend that the surplus has no a priori categories of measurement. However, and here we are re-stating a proposition of our analysis made elsewhere (especially Chapters 5.4 and 11), if we focus on the social relationship of staking, and the propensity of agents to stake performances in the anticipation that those performances will create social-validated outcomes which the network can value via the identification of derivative spreads, then we are identifying the measurement of attributes of the surplus-value of life, even if that surplus is defined as beyond measurement.");

Reciprocal staking is the mode of entry to the commons. The other is the exchange of particular commodities that have commons' properties. Some outputs will be 'public goods,' defined as outputs where one person's consumption does not preclude (indeed, may enhance) the consumption of others (for example data compiled by the network, public art, a clean environment). We believe that the second dimension is already well understood, and is not specific to the new economic space, so our focus is the commons that arises from mutual staking, or what we call the 'synthetic commons.' In finance the term 'synthetic' is used to describe instruments that are engineered to simulate the performance of other assets. In the Economic Space protocol, private ownership can, in certain circumstances, simulate the interests of collective ownership.\\nEach of these is considered in turn.");

If all agents in the network are reciprocally staked with all other agents either directly or transitively[104] then every agent is a partial owner of every other agent's performances. It may not be a large proportion of stake in the first instance, but it is significantly greater than zero. These are the conditions in which private ownership exhibits the same interests as common ownership: a synthetic commons. It is as if reciprocal staking across the network cancels out the effects (interests) of private ownership, for when each agent benefits from the success of every other agent, individual interests converge with collective interests.");
        units.push("It is not the intention of the new economic space that common interest be purely accidental. The proposal for enacting a synthetic commons is that each agent intentionally manages their reciprocal staking portfolio so as to secure a proportional reciprocal stake across the network. We term this combination of stake the '_commons asset profile_.' Automated stake trading can find the optimal path for each agent (and all agents) to secure their desired holding of the commons asset profile. Some agents will seek a large holding of the commons asset profile; others less. The proportion of an agent's stake held in the commons asset profile determines the level of their access to the commons. So individual agents can choose whether to enter the commons and the level at which they hold membership. They can change this level by changing their reciprocal staking.");

        units.push("An agent will enter the commons in order to acquire access to these dividends. Some performances for the commons will be of the same kind as performances not for the commons; it will be just the dividends that are available to the commons. Other performances will be commons-specific, in the sense that they are designed so as to be collectively accessible. For example:\\n- _Data._ The network will be 'spontaneously' producing a vast quantity of data that will be useful for each agent in order to monitor the health of the network and to inform their own decision-making. Yet each agent owns their own data, so that these aggregate data cannot be compiled and released without mutual agreement. The commons provides the means to co-ordinate and distribute network data. A condition of accessing collective data is that each agent must offer their own data in order to access collective data. Different levels of participation in the commons will be linked to different levels of data exchange and access.\\n- _Public goods._ There will be some outputs that benefit from scaled access. For some, there will be no exclusion. Agents in the network can access such outputs irrespective of whether they join the commons. But other performances have different attributes, where the possibility of scaling is large but exclusion is required (for example, a concert with a significant but limited audience capacity). These outputs may be offered to the commons. Access to these outputs (and their outcomes) could be conditional upon an agent's level of commons membership.\\n- _Free goods._ Some outputs are not produced so as to be sold, but they nonetheless produce value because they meet a recognized need within the network. We know they produce value because agents in the network are staking the performances that generate these outputs.[105] These outputs can be attributed a synthetic price (for purposes of data collection), and may be thought of as gifts to members of the commons (see Chapter 3.5).");

This assumed equivalence embeds a redistributional agenda: the _capacity_ to contribute and the _need_ to draw down.[108]\\n- _Underwriting lower-performing stake._ The requirement that agents will likely hold (directly or transitively) a proportional stake across the network gives temporary advantage to agents with lower-priced, lower performing stake, for all agents must hold some (small) exposure to these performances in order to hold the commons asset profile. Many of these performances will be in long-term decline, so the commons asset profile gives their stake some support to smooth the price trend. The threshold levels of reciprocal staking that constitute different levels of commons participation will need to be sensitive to this process.");
        units.push("The commons can also be designed as a system of intentional redistribution. The desirability, level and mechanisms of redistribution are matters of protocol design, so we here just nominate the sorts of mechanisms that might be implemented.\\n- _Absolute or relative reciprocal staking?_ The process of agents' reciprocal staking as the mode of entry to the commons opens the issue of how to measure an agent's level of holding of the commons asset profile. Will it be the absolute level of mutual staking consistent with the commons asset profile, or the percentage of each agent's stake held in that portfolio? The latter clearly gives cheaper commons access to agents with smaller stake portfolios.\\n- _Decay to the commons._ Protocols could design the conditions under which the ownership of stake could revert to the commons directly or indirectly (i.e. to other agents in proportion to their commons membership). The condition of decay could relate to issues like activity on the network (dormant performances decay to the commons) or the size or concentration of ownership of performances (high priced stake or concentrated ownership could trigger conversion to commons ownership).[109]");

There is an international, invariant standard for a centimeter, preserved by the International Bureau for Weights and Measures; there is no such basis for a dollar and no one can explain precisely the purchasing power of a US dollar, or any fiat currency. Further, although a tape may be rolled out to measure distance, there is no such formula for asset value.[112] The hidden lesson from the analogy is telling: all measures are social conventions, but only some can be adopted as if they are invariant.

        units.push("Below are the prevalent measures.\\n- _Measure of value._ The outcomes of performances must be measured in a way that network value cant be attributed. Every performance proposal cannot be presumed to create 'value' for the network; the network must express an evaluation of whether the effects of the performance (its outcomes) are sufficient to be declared 'value.' The measurement here is related to the determination of 'what is sufficient' and it can only take the form of a spread between what was offered and what was then achieved. It cannot be a single network-wide unit of measurement (like a tape measure) for it is specific to each performance.\\n- _Market Offers._ These measure value in exchange. When matched, market offers are a way of measuring the rate of exchange at any given time between any two commodities, referred to as exchange value. When unmatched, exchange offers are understood to express views on potential exchange value. The exchange value of any asset can be calculated in terms of any other, but it is convention to use one specific asset to express these offers.[113] This asset is given the status of 'money of account' and is used to communicate exchange value in a standardized way. In the Economic Space Protocol, this asset is credit denominated in the unit of exchange.\\n- _Unit of exchange; unit of credit_. These measure commodity and credit rates of exchange. The unit of exchange is utilized as a common denominator in which to express exchanges, enabling the matching algorithm to gradually fill an order. Rather than 'deriving' the unit from the exchanges, we acknowledge its presence from the start, and express all exchange offers with it. This does not require credit, but just divisibility of the assets being exchanged in 'chunks' of these units. This unit becomes most visible to the users, when it is utilized to create units of credit which are, basically, credits measured in units of exchange.[114]\\n- _Commodity Specifications._ A distinct class of commodity (or particular attribute of multiple commodity types) can be compared qualitatively and quantitatively, A commodity specification is the aggregate of information (not just provided by the issuer of the commodities) that can be created by the network to enable a comparison.\\n- _Performance Metrics_. These measure the level of economic activity in the network. Associated with stake, a performance metric is derived from the records of the performance of an economic space, and compiled into distinct quantitative data that can be compared throughout time. As distinct forms of measurement and valuation, they are important benchmarks that influence the participation and the staking decisions of agents on a particular space. Anyone can create and publish a performance index, or adopt them. Performance metrics can be tokenized, be distributed as dividends, utilized as qualified and quantified forms of participation recognition, and/or exchanged in a market.\\n- _Offer matches over a unit of time._ These measure exchange value flow. We can trace the value flow between any two agents, or any two groups of agents by compiling the information contained in the offer records, where time can also be 'tick time,'[115] represented by the overall offer matching events, within the range being measured. This is valuable information for agents' credit issuance and staking decisions.\\n- _Stake exchange value_. This measures 'economic space agency.' It is important to measure the exchange rate of a particular space's stake in terms of units of exchange. The larger this value is, the larger the capacity of an agent to exert influence in the network, and express value. This unit compresses, but still retains, the assemblage of the qualities and quantities associated with an economic space.");
        units.push("The Economic Space Protocol challenges the traditional notion that exchanges must involve a money instrument in order to be executed. With distributed token issuance, tokens are not a store of value and stake is not converted to free-standing tokens when sold. Performance metrics, not just price, determine the network's valuation of an asset. Abstract units of exchange are deployed to increase the matching capacity of an exchange offer. These modes of measurement are associated with three distinctive exchange practices of the new economic space.\\n- _An abstract unit of exchange._ Exchange offers are expressed through an abstract unit of exchange, where the rates of exchange between any two commodities are translated to these units. Through netting, exchanges can occur without the need to hold and then use a mediating financial instrument (i.e. money). This is of particular importance, since money in a capitalist economy is effectively the 'right to express exchange value.'\\n- _Reciprocally issued credit._ The Economic Space Protocol's money equivalent is reciprocally issued credit, denominated in units of exchange/units of credit. Agent credit issuance, like agent stake issuance, is determined by the lending/investing parties and is integral to the process of value determination in the network. Staking processes signal the network determination of value-creating performances; credit issuance and settlement through clearing - and the determination of what performance outputs can be credited - expresses value in a monetary form.\\n- _No interest credit._ Credit in the Economic Space Protocol does not generate interest payment in the capitalist sense. This frees agents from following the profit seeking heuristics of capital, and to focus instead on other forms of surplus transfer denominated in different units, and representing different measures of value (see Appendix 6.2). Dividends do not need to be converted into credits in order for them to be distributed. This is a different way of distributing the value that agents create, where an output (or an outcome), needs not be framed to be seeking a market.");

        units.push("In most conceivable claims to outcomes, an absolute measure may be impossible, for there is no baseline. So the objective, as with social impact bonds, is to create a measurable spread between two unmeasurables. In the social investment bond described in Appendix 4.1, the success of a policy intervention had no absolute units of measure, but the spread between a control group and an intervention group could be measured precisely.");
        units.push("How would this framing of a spread play out in the new economic space? It will be an iterative process of stake price spreads widening and narrowing. When a performance is offered for staking, the performing agent nominates some target outcomes that can be independently verified. Achieving these outcomes is the performer's claim to creating social value. It is the process of staking and the market for stake that will verify these claims to value creation.");
        units.push("Certain stakers may, after negotiation, make a positive financial evaluation of the potential for that performance to create outcomes which will meet the conditions of being declared 'value.' Those stakers have taken a risk, in anticipation of some form of reward. The rest of the network, which has not acquired stake in the performance, may nonetheless be evaluating the performance contract, perhaps changing their stake in the agents who have staked the performance. If the performance outcome targets are met, the outputs are declared to be value in the network (and validated for clearing credit in the network).");
        units.push("The rest of the network now declares its judgment. When outcome targets are met, the network may judge that those targets were in some way inappropriate. They express this by selling off their stake holdings in the agents who staked the performance. When the outcome targets of a performance are exceeded, the next circuit of performance will _probably_ see higher outcome targets in the performance offer. This is a signal to the network that this performance is producing increasing amounts of value, and it will attract new stakers: its stake price will increase. Where targets are not met, the next circuit will _probably_ need to set lower targets (or performance termination) and stake price will fall.");
        units.push("The underlying process is that the network's evaluation of the attribution of value to the outcomes of a performance plays out not attempting to attribute a direct price to those outcomes; it plays out as spreads on stake prices. Here we see an important reason not to collapse network information simply to stake price, for it can disguise the social meanings transmitted in the network, of which price is just one. 'Lying behind' the shifting staking prices are the simultaneous determination of what constitutes value and how claims to value creation are verified. Here, we see rich network data - economic media - as the bearer of the process of value expression.");
        units.push("CONCLUSION: BASIC CATEGORIES");
        units.push("The proposition of the new economic space is that the condition of postcapitalist measurement centers on the mechanism by which agents in the network reveal their collective view of what constitutes value. The condition of measurement is that this expression be quantifiable in some way.");
        units.push("The processes of the Economic Space Protocol provide the mechanism for the determination of a range of measures by which to monitor and evaluate. Some are generated across all performances and become indices of comparison on the basis of which analytical propositions can be built. Others are constituted as spreads, designed to capture the subjective evaluations of agents. They can all be critical measures, but because they are calculated differently, they are not reducible to a single measure.");
        units.push("Value measures, for example, cannot be directly expressed in prices for they are not expressions of exchange although, we conjecture, they will be indirectly expressed through stake price movements. We anticipate the network will create many indices of activity and measures of performance: they will themselves be a field of performances.");
