Because of its abstract character, it is often forgotten that information must have a material substrate, be it the standard commodity or an array of atoms on a computer chip. For the briefest of sketches, consider that the commodity was always composed of readable material differences, differences in matter created through labor. As a wager to get from M to M', the commodity's market legibility as a significant state of informed matter (a 'hieroglyph') has become increasingly computational. For my take on the networked commodity and the intimate connections between computing and capital see Beller (2017 and 2021).

There, commodity production has two dimensions: it is extractive, in the sense that commodities are produced by the workers and owned by the capitalist, and it is produced so as to be sold for a profit. This latter emphasis gives rise to the term 'commodification,' with more and more facets of social life converted into marketable opportunities for extraction. Our use of the term 'commodity' is more like Staffa (1960) in his book _Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities_. There, commodities are all produced outputs. They are produced for a market, but they are not exchanged for money. This gives space for our proposition that commodities can be produced for the commons (without a price). Similarly, there can be no suggestion that our use of the term commodity is subject to a 'fetishism' of commodities, developed by Marx (1867) at the end Chapter 1 of Volume I of _Capital_, for this term, too, is capitalist-specific.

This is the accounting dimension of the so-called 'Cambridge Critique' of capital theory which argues, in essence, that there is circularity in the conventional theory of capital: the value of capital cannot be specified until its rate of return is known and its rate of return cannot be known until capital is valued.
